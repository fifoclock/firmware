# FILO firmware
for firmware / software running on the embedded platform

FILO uses the [Micronucleus](https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus) bootloader.  
See the `micronucleus_config` directory for a config folder that you can drop into micronucleus 
and compile. There is also a precompiled boot.hex available for flashing.
