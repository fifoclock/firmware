# FIFO firmware
for firmware / software running on the embedded platform

FIFO uses the [Micronucleus](https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus) bootloader, which uses [V-USB](https://www.obdev.at/vusb/).  
See the `micronucleus_config` directory for a config folder that you can drop into micronucleus
and compile. There is also a precompiled boot.hex available for flashing.
